# Bashmarks: Directory Bookmarks for Bash

Provides bookmarking ability for directories in bash.

## Installation

To install, put `bashmarks.sh` somewhere such as `~/bin`, then source it 
in your `.bashrc` file (or other bash startup file):

    source ~/bin/bashmarks.sh
    
## Usage

To bookmark a folder, simply go to that folder, then bookmark it like so:

    bookmark foo

The bookmark will be named "foo"

When you want to get back to that folder use:

    cdd foo

To see a list of the bookmarks:

    cdd ?

Tab completion works, to go to the *shoobie* folder:

    cdd sho<TAB>

Bookmarks are stored in a file called `.bookmarks` in the user's home unless a
different full path is set in the `BASHMARKS_FILE` environment variable.
